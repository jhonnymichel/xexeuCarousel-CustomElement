# Xexeu-Carousel custom element.
This is a Carousel HTML custom element, built using ES6 classes, modules and the [HTML Custom Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements) specification.

## A glimpse of the future
Custom elements have only recently stabilized, therefore most browsers won't ble able to run this code, but all the code in this repo is **native** and if you're using the last version of Google Chrome, you will be able to run it without transpiling anything.

## Dependencies
No module blunder or task runner (besides NPM) is being used here. browser-sync is the only dev-dependency on the project and there is no production-dependency.

## Running the project
1. clone the repository
2. run ```npm install```
3. run ```npm start```
4. access the development server using the address informed at the console prompt (default is localhost:3000)
